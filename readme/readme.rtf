in this piece of code i summerize the work on a novel algorithm to make kernel SVM more efficient for large-scale learning,
the idea is explained in details in our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10182 
Dual SVM training on a budget, which has been accepted in ICPRAM 2019, invited to be extended in Springer and submitted with more 
optimized methods for the Journal of Machine Learning.
